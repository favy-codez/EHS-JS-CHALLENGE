    <h1>DAY 3</h1>
    <!-- 
        you will be tasked with building a click counter application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will work with event listeners, particularly the 'click' event. You should be comfortable with basic HTML and CSS concepts, as well as JavaScript syntax and functions.
        
        In the click counter application, there will be a button and a paragraph element. Each time the user clicks on the button, the click counter will increment by 1 and its value will be displayed in the paragraph element. To complete this lab, you will have to attach event listeners to appropriate HTML elements and write necessary JavaScript code to update the click counter value in the paragraph element.
        
        This lab will help you understand how event listeners work and how to use them effectively to respond to user interactions. You will learn to add event listeners using JavaScript and update the DOM elements with their new values.
        
        ------
        
        Add a 'click' event listener to the button - Attach a 'click' event listener to the button element with the id counterButton. Remember to choose the appropriate method to target the element and add the event listener. Make sure the event listener is not null.
        
        Increment the click counter when the button is clicked - In the event listener, create a function that increments the click counter each time the button is clicked. The current click counter value is displayed in the paragraph element with the id clickCounter.
        
        Update the paragraph element with the new click counter value - After incrementing the click counter, update the contents of the paragraph element clickCounter with the new value, reflecting the total number of button clicks
